# go.resonite.com

A tiny website to handle go.resonite.com links.

## Development Principles
1. Keep is Simple - Avoid additional Frameworks or libraries unless they have a defined goal or feature that they unlock.
2. Keep Dependencies Down - Avoid excess dependencies
3. Prioritize raw HTML5 - Semantic tags over divs

## Notes
This was put together quite quickly, to fix the needs of go.resonite.com not working. The design isn't the best, but it will be ok for now!
